## Self-Reflection: This lab went pretty well compared to the others, the last part took a bit since trying to find the needed code ID's in googles inspec feature is like finding a needle in a haystack but I think it turned out pretty good


### How long it took me to finish this?

4 hours, like i said it took forever to find the right ID's.
